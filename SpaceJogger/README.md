# Space Jogger

Space Jogger is composed of two main components: the game itself, developed in Unity,\
and the **PyOpenCVHeadRecognition** module, which is used for head tracking to control the avatar within the game.\
Currently, we are experiencing some issues with socket communication between the two repositories.\
As a result, player movement is temporarily restricted to using keyboard arrow keys but the problem could be easily fixed with more time.
