 # Goal

**Our goal it's to make astronauts workouts less boring!**\
To achieve this, we're developing a series of mini-games that can be integrated with training equipment like treadmills and rowers,\
with a focus on engaging different body parts, especially the hands and head. We've launched with three mini-games: Space Jogger, Astray, and Star Float.\
These games enhance what can often be monotonous training by adding elements of gamification and visual interaction. We're planning to include a scoreboard for each game, \
allowing astronauts to challenge each other in an arcade-style competition.\
This feature aims to make workouts more interactive and competitive, increasing motivation and engagement.

Another feature we haven't yet implemented is the interaction between the games and the sensors on the training machines themselves. For instance, as the game level increases in difficulty, the treadmill could automatically speed up, and conversely, slow down if it detects that the astronaut is fatigued. This dynamic adjustment aims to synchronize the physical challenge with the gaming experience.
